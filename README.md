# deinvisioner
Removes chrome from Invision prototype (for more realistic presentations)

To install: You'll need to follow the instructions to *turn on developer mode* in Chrome and then *install the .crx file* into Chrome Extensions.  Note that all you need to download is de_invisioner.crx from this repository if you only want to install; the source code is provided in the de_invisioner folder for those who wish to improve upon the extension.
