# deinvisioner
Removes chrome from Invision prototype (for more realistic presentations)

To install: You'll need to follow the instructions to *turn on developer mode* in Chrome and then *install the .crx file* into Chrome Extensions.  Note that all you need to download is de_invisioner.crx from this repository if you only want to install; the source code is provided in the de_invisioner folder for those who wish to improve upon the extension.

**Instructions**:
*From https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/*

1. Click the three-dot button in the top right-hand corner of Chrome and go to More Tools > Extensions. Add a check to the box next to Developer mode at the top of the page.

1. Locate the *.CRX file on your computer, then drag and drop it onto the Extensions page. A pop-up will appear showing you the permissions the extension will have, and asking you to confirm the install. Click Add to finish the installation.

Now you will be able to install extensions that are not hosted in the Chrome Web Store. However, please do so at your own risk, and make sure to read permissions for each extension very carefully. If you need to remove an extension, you can do so by clicking the trash can icon next to it on the Extensions page.
